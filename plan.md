**Updated Outline**
- Semantics: “delete” means archive (move to archived); “rename” edits session metadata title only (no filename changes).
- Rename the picker module + entry point (e.g., `resume_picker.rs` → `sessions_picker.rs`, `run_resume_picker` → `run_sessions_picker`) and update call sites.
- Update UI copy to match broader scope:
  - Header “Sessions” or “Manage sessions” instead of “Resume a previous session.”
  - Key hints reflect resume/rename/archive/toggles.
- Session actions:
  - `Enter` resume, `r` rename, `x` archive, `Esc` close, `Ctrl+C` exit.
  - Inline rename prompt; prefill title; `Enter` save, `Esc` cancel; empty clears title.
  - Archive confirmation modal: “Archive session?” with `Enter` archive, `Esc` cancel.
  - List refresh after rename/archive; keep selection stable when possible.
- Archived view:
  - Toggle (e.g., `a`) to switch active/archived in the picker.
  - `/archived` opens picker in archived mode.
- Show‑all toggle:
  - Toggle (e.g., `o`) to switch cwd‑scoped vs all sessions in‑picker.
- Entry points:
  - `/sessions` opens the picker.
  - `/resume` inside existing chat opens the picker.
  - `/archived` opens picker in archived mode.
- ESC behavior:
  - From in‑chat `/sessions`/`/resume`/`/archived`, `Esc` returns to that chat.
  - From `codex resume`, keep current “start fresh/exit” behavior.
- Testing:
  - Run required tests; if any failures are unrelated to these changes, note and ignore them.
- Versioning and docs:
  - After completing changes, add a commit.
  - Then bump minor version, update docs and/or snapshots if needed, and commit again.
