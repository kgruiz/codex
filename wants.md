# Wants List

Add new items below as you think of them.

- [x] Queued message editing + queue popup + per-item model/thinking + pause behavior (see `plan.md`)
- [ ] Add a keybind (e.g. `Tab`) to change thinking level quickly (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2920)
  - Allow changing thinking level after typing a prompt without cutting/pasting or leaving the editor.
  - Consider direct shortcuts like `Cmd+1/2/3…` for tiers (or a picker like `Cmd+M`).
- [ ] Add a keybind (e.g. `Tab`) to change model quickly (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2920)
  - Make model switching possible mid-edit, even after writing a long prompt.
  - Keep the UX comparable to ChatGPT (change any time) rather than requiring slash commands.
- [ ] Export chats as Markdown
- [ ] Add current model name to the status line (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2920)
  - Show the active model/thinking setting in the status bar so it is obvious what will be used on submit.
- [ ] Syntax highlighting (code blocks)
- [ ] Rename chats
- [ ] Show tokens/sec (and other live stats like latency, cost, tool time)
- [ ] Support handing off long prompts to external editor via `Ctrl+G`
- [ ] Edit last message without branching
- [ ] Paste images from clipboard via `Cmd+V` when clipboard contains an image (toggleable)
- [ ] Use `Shift+Enter` for newline instead of `Option+Enter` (toggleable)
- [ ] Configure any shortcuts (keymap/config file) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/3049)
  - Add a `[keybindings]` section to `config.toml` mapping actions (newline, backspace, move, etc.) to key chords.
  - Document supported key names/modifiers (`Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, `Enter`, single chars) and defaults.
- [ ] Render images inline in terminal output when supported (iTerm image protocol, Kitty graphics, etc.) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/6123)
  - Render pasted images or image links/previews directly in the terminal when the terminal supports it.
  - Fall back gracefully (e.g. show URL/alt text) when inline rendering is unavailable.
- [ ] In-TUI session management (list/switch/rename/delete sessions) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/6500)
  - Add an interactive `/session` view to list and switch sessions with metadata (name, ID, last activity, directory).
  - Support `/session rename …` and `/session delete …`, plus optional non-TUI subcommands (`codex session …`).
- [ ] Configurable submit vs newline behavior (Enter, Ctrl+Enter, Alt/Option+Enter, Shift+Enter) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/5716, https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/6100)
  - Provide a config option to swap defaults (Enter inserts newline, `Ctrl+Enter` submits) for multi-line-first workflows.
  - Consider restoring/making optional the “Alt/Option+Enter submits” behavior mentioned as a regression.
- [ ] TUI appearance settings (hide startup tips, session header, placeholder title) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/6089)
  - Add toggles to hide startup tips and session header, and to hide/replace the placeholder title.
  - Support a minimal “prompt + output” startup layout.
- [ ] Fix prompt editor copy/paste behavior (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V, etc.) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/5325)
  - Make common shortcuts non-destructive, and support copying the current prompt text from within the TUI.
  - Ensure paste behaves as expected (instead of clearing prompt content).
- [ ] Support Alt+d delete-word-forward (readline-style) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/5018)
  - Implement readline `M-d`: delete from cursor to end of current word (word-kill forward).
- [ ] Platform-specific key-hint formatting on macOS (⌃ ⌥ ⇧, Fn+Arrow alternatives) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/4914)
  - Display macOS-style modifier symbols (⌃ ⌥ ⇧) and optionally omit verbose names for cleaner hints.
  - Include `Fn+Arrow` alternatives for PageUp/PageDown/Home/End on compact keyboards; keep other platforms unchanged.
- [ ] `/status` should list global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` / `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/3793)
  - `/status` should include the global AGENTS file in the “AGENTS files” list when present (expected vs actual).
- [ ] Customizable status line (show cwd, git branch, etc.) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2926)
  - Show project context like current working directory and git branch in the status line.
  - Consider making the status line user-configurable (similar to Claude Code).
- [ ] Add colors/highlighting for emphasis (thinking vs final, headers) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2711)
  - Add configurable color settings to distinguish thinking vs final output.
  - Highlight headers/sections like next steps/recommendations for better scanability.
- [ ] Interactive history reverse search (Ctrl+R) (https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2622)
  - `Ctrl+R` enters reverse-i-search with fuzzy/substring matching; repeated `Ctrl+R` cycles matches (`Ctrl+S` forward).
  - Enter accepts, Escape cancels, and editing the selected prompt should be easy (exit search and edit in place).
  - Persist history with configurable size limits and optional frecency ordering.
